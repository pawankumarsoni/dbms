DBMS :

1) what is dbms 
DBMS is a program that controls maintain and use of a database .
Dbms can be termed as file manager that manage data in database rether than saving it in files .

2) What is RDBMS 
RDBMS stands for relational database management system . RDBMS store the data into the
collection of tables which is related by common field between the column of the table . 
It also provide relational operators to manipulate the data stored into the tables .
Ex. SQL server

3)SQL structure query language : 
It's  used to communicate with the Database . This is a standard 
language used to perform tasks such as update , insert , deletion of data from a database .
standard SQL command is select .
sql is dml & ddl .

4) What is a database : 
Nothing but organise form of data for easy access , storing , retrieval , managing of data .
Ex . school management database , bank management database 

5) Tables & Fields : 

A table is set of data that are organised in a model with columns & Rows .
Colums can be organised As vertical & Rows are horizontal . A table has specified number of columns called as fields but 
have any number of rows which is called records .
Ex .
Emp have Emp id Emp name name dob 
data 201456

6) What is a primary key : 

A primary key is a combination of fields which uniquely identifie a row .
This is special kind of unique key , and it has implicit NOT NULL constraint . it means priary key values cannot be null .

7) Unique key : 

A unique key constraint uniquely identifies each record in database & provides uniqueness for the column or set of columns . A table may have more than one unique 
keys .



8) foreign keys : 

A foreign key in one table which can be related to the primary key of another table .
Relationship needs to be created between two tables by refrencing foreign key with primary key of another table .
You can not delete foreign key because it refrence to another table as primary key .
   
9) Joins : This is a keyword used to query data from more tables based on the relationship between the fields of the tables .
 keys play a major role when joins are used .

10) types of join : 


Inner join : Return when there is atleast one match of rows between the tables .

right join : Right join return rows whioch are common between the tables & all 
rows of right hand side . simply it return all rows from the right hand side table even though they are no matches in the left hand side table .

Same as left join but return all rows of left tables .

Full join :  return all the rows of left hand side table & all the rows of the right hand side table .

11) Normalization : 

normalization is the process of minimising redundancy and dependency  
by organising  fields and tables of a database . The main aim of normalisation is to add , delete or modify field that can be 
made in a single table .
